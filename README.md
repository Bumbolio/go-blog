# Take-home Assessment

Thanks for taking the time to complete this assessment! It really helps us find out a little about some of your skills without having to drag you through more interviews.

## Spend no more than 2 hours

From the time you fork and clone this repo, you should spend no more than 2 *uninterrupted* hours on this assessment. (If you have trouble installing `hugo` or getting the starter code to run, don't count that time)

You may spend less time. Don't worry if you feel like you're submitting something *incomplete* or *not good enough*. We're not looking for perfection.

## Use any tools you like

This is a [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) project with [tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) preinstalled via npm. You *do* have to use hugo, but if you aren't familiar with tailwind feel free to use vanilla CSS or any other CSS framework you like.

Feel free to install any packages or tooling you like, just make sure to include instructions on how to install them in the README.

## Your Task

Your job is to complete a single blog post: "What is a Goroutine?". You're expected to:

* Write the blog post in markdown (`/content/what-is-a-goroutine.md`). We are assessing your ability to craft an informative and engaging blog post, so do your best!
* Style the site, but we are assessing you on your UI/UX skills so do your best!

Our goal is to learn about your skills in building a simple learning experience. We're focused on communication and front-end skills here, the in-person interview is where we'll cover backend stuff.
